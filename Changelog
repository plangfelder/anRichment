	. 4 sets that have mislabeled direction of DE dropped: 
	  Up-regulated genes in striatum of 6 mon HD Q140 mice vs Q20 (Aaronson, GSE78274 via HDSigDB)
	  Up-regulated genes in striatum of 10 mon HD Q140 mice vs Q20 (Aaronson, GSE78274 via HDSigDB)
	  Down-regulated genes in striatum of 6 mon HD Q140 mice vs Q20 (Aaronson, GSE78274 via HDSigDB)
	  Down-regulated genes in striatum of 10 mon HD Q140 mice vs Q20 (Aaronson, GSE78274 via HDSigDB)

	. Documentation is cleaned up and hopefully usable.

	. Added sets of DE genes for Htt lowering in 6m mouse striatum, Q175
	  and WT mice, data by Nan Wang, analysis by Peter Langfelder

	. Bugfix: buldGOcollection now works with organism yeast and more
	  generally where there are mismatches between general and
	  organism-specific GO data.

	. New package with old name. This package contains mostly data, with a
	  few functions to access them and create collections from public data
	  such as GO and MSigDB.
